# Similar to lists, you can iterate over strings:

# text = "Hey"
# for char in text:
#     print(char)
# Output:

# H
# e
# y
# Using index:

# for i in range(len(text)):
#     print(f"position {i}: {text[i]}")
# Output:

# position 0: H
# position 1: e
# position 2: y

# Challenge

# Easy
# Create a program that receives a string as input, and it prints how many times the character p (or P) is in the string.

# Some chars might be uppercase, use char.lower() to convert it to lowercase.

text = input()

count = 0
for char in text:
    if char.lower() == "p":
        count+=1
print(count)
