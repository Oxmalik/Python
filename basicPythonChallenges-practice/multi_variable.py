# Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

# Assign values to three variables name, age, and city in a single line. Set name to "Alice", 
# age to 30, and city to "New York".

# Assign the value 100 to three variables x, y, and z in a single line.

# Create a list named colors containing the values "red", "green", and "blue". 
# Assign these values to three variables color1, color2, and color3 in a single line.

name, age, city = "Alice", 30, "New York"

x = y = z = 100

colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

color1,  color2, color3 = colors
