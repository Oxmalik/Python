# Create a Python program that calculates the area of a circle 
# using a constant for the value of PI. Define a constant named PI and set
#  its value to 3.14159. Then, prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle. 
# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula (area = PI * radius**2) and print the result.

# Remember to follow the naming convention for constants by using all uppercase letters for
#  the variable PI.

PI = 3.14159
radius = float(input())
# area = 0.0

# radius = input()

area = PI * radius**2
print(area)
